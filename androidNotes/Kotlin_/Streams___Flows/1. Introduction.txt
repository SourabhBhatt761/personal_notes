There are 2 types of streams

1) Channels (hot observable)

2) Flows (cold observable)






						**CHANNELS**

They do not depend upon the observer they simply emit all the data even if there's no observer
eg. -> chat app, movie halls







						**Flows**
They send the data only when there's a observer 
eg-> netflix

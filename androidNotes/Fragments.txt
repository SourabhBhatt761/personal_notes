Activity to fragment 

* Create fragment in activity main set it's id 
* findNavController(R.id.given_id).navigate(id produced by nav graph)

1)	Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
    bundle.putInt("some_int", 0);

    getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
        .setReorderingAllowed(true)
		.addToBackStack()
        .add(R.id.fragment_container_view, ExampleFragment.class, bundle)
        .commit();
				
				
	After opening ExampleFragment.class you can get the bundle by calling :-
	getArguments().getInt("some_int);
		

	-> .setReorderingAllowed(true)
	Sets whether or not to allow optimizing operations within and across transactions. 
	This will remove redundant operations, eliminating operations that cancel. 
	For example, if two transactions are executed together, one that adds a fragment A and the next replaces it with fragment B, the operations will cancel and only fragment B will be added. 
	That means that fragment A may not go through the creation/destruction lifecycle.
	
	-> .addToBackStack()
	Add this transaction to the back stack. 
	This means that the transaction will be remembered after it is committed, and will reverse its operation when later popped off the stack.
				
	-> .add()
	This adds a fragment on the fragment_container_view
	
	-> .replace()
	This replaces the fragment which was present in fragment_container_view and adds.
	This is a short method for .replace() = .add() + .remove()
	
	
				
2) 	Fragments can host one or more child fragments. 
	Inside a fragment, you can get a reference to the FragmentManager that manages the fragment's children through getChildFragmentManager(). 
	If you need to access its host FragmentManager, you can use getParentFragmentManager().				
				


getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
.replace(R.id.fragmentContainer,ProfileFragment())

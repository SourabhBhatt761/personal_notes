* addOnCompleteListener -> for success and failure both can be evaluated
* addOnSuccessListener -> for success only
* addOnFailureListener -> for failure only


* ValueEventListener -> it fires if only the value of a node changes
* ChildEventListener -> fires if that node's child value also changes

	CVL can fire many times use wisely.


* addValueEventListener() ->  keep listening to query or database reference it is attached to.
* addListenerForSingleValueEvent() -> executes onDataChange method immediately and after executing that method once, it stops listening to the reference location it is attached to.

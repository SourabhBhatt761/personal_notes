A service is a component that runs on the background(main thread) to perform long running tasks `WITH NO USER INTERFACE`



					: BACKGROUND SERVICE :

It is a service that runs only when the app is running. App closed then the service will also be terminated

e.g. -> playing music in background, it plays the music untill the app is killed





					: FOREGROUND SERVICE : 

It is a service which stays alive even when the app is terminated.
e.g. -> downloading , location tracking in unolo, we've to show a notification for foreground service.

- START_STICKY: This is used for services that are explicitly started and stopped as needed.
- START_NOT_STICKY: This is used to let the OS know that there is a need to stay alive only when there is a command that has to be run. This can mean that the OS can kill the service if a higher priority Service has to be run.
- START_REDELIVER_INTENT: This has the same property as that of the START_NOT_STICKY, except if the OS kills it, the Service gets fired once again! This is really important if you are going to be creating a long-running ForegroundService (Might also be a bounded service).

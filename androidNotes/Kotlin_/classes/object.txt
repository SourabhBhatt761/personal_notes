Kotlin has an object keyword, which combines both declaring a class and creating an instance of it in one action. 


object Singleton {
    fun sayMyName() {
        println("I'm a singleton")
    }
}



-> object creates a class and prepares an object for it everything handles internally 
-> USAGE???   -> it is a SINGLETON object !!!

@ActivityRetainedScoped
class Repository @Inject constructor(
    remoteDataSource: RemoteDataSource
){

  val remote = remoteDataSource

}


-> @ActivityRetainedScoped this is used in repo bcz even if the state 
	changes(landscape or pressed back button) repo should survive , like viewModels as 
	they require repo

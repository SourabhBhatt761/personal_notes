@HiltViewModel
class MainViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val repository: Repository,
    application: Application
) : AndroidViewModel(application) {

}


-> @Inject with the help of this we don't need to make factory . 
	Dagger will handle everything internally.
-> @HiltViewModel annotaion is used to describe our dagger that 
	this is a viewModel.

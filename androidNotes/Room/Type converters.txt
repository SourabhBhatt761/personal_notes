//room can store primitive data types data classes can be stored with the annotation @Embedded

//here Priority was an enum class

class Converter {

    @TypeConverter
    fun fromPriority(priority: Priority): String {
        return priority.name
    }

    @TypeConverter
    fun toPriority(priority: String): Priority {
        return Priority.valueOf(priority)
    }

}


-> we don't need to do anything else (except annotating db with @Typeconverter) android will do everything for us
